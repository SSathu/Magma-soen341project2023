# SOEN-341-Project

<p> The project that we will develop in the following weeks consists of a website/application that connects job seekers and employers.
This career services platform enables employers to advertise job openings and job seekers to maintain an online portfolio. 
Both parties can create accounts, log in, view and apply for jobs, manage job postings, and receive notifications.
The platform provides a secure and efficient solution for job recruitment and job searching.  </p>
